#Calculating the area of a circle


# storing 3.14 in a variable called pi
pi = 3.14
# Accepting input (radius) from the user.
radius = float(input("Type in the raduis of the circle :   "))
# Using the formula to calculate the Area
Area = (pi * radius ** 2)
# Printing out the calculation to the console.
